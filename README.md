#  Ardemu - An ATMega328p Chip Emulator
## (C) 2018 - 86Pixels

## What is Ardemu?
Ardemu is an emulator designed for the ATMega328p series of microprocessors commonly found on the Arduino board. It has nearly complete instruction set support.

## How is this different than a simulator?
Ardemu differs from a simulator by emulating all of the ATMega instructions exactly as they're implemented. Ardemu is also designed to run Arduino sketches natively on other platforms with enhanced capabilities.
